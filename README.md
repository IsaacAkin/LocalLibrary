# LocalLibrary

## Overview

The `Local Library` is an updated version of the [Library Record System](https://github.com/IsaacAkin/LibraryRecordSystem) that I previously made. This version is a web application as opposed to a console application and has full database integration using `MySql`. The system supports two types of users: librarians and customers. Each user type has distinct functionalities:

- `Librarians` can: add, remove, and manage books, customers, and loans.
- `Customers` can: return books, search for books, and view their current loans.

The application is built with C# ASP.NET and MySql
